# Session Noter

Python package to play around with:
- interfaces (text-based and graphical)
- data processing and reporting
- modularity and plugins
- meta-programming

Purpose of the package as such is to support session-based test management (SBTM) - inspired by Shmuel Gershon's Rapid Reporter (http://testing.gershon.info/reporter/).
